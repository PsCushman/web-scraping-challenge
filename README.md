# web-scraping-challenge

This challenege takes two website addresses about Mars news and Rover data and asks the student to do various iterations and analysis using what we have learned about web scraping.

I used geeksforgeeks a few times to find simpilfied ways to write by for loops.

I also spoke to my tutor about using code to find the length of a Mars year using the rover data. While he did not write any code for me, he did point me in the right direction.
